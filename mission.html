    <p>Our companyâ€™s field of activity would be described <br>as something within technology and social care. This <br> is because of what kind of characteristics our product <br> is equipped, and how it is built. Such as robotics, artificial intelligence, <br> and how it is able to be a social companion. Some further explanation <br> for the social/care aspect of our product would be, how it is able to for <br> example remind the user of appointments or talk about everyday things.</p>
